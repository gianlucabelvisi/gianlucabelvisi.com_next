Meet Semola.

![Semola](./semola.jpg)

My sister found him in a parking lot when he was a tiny **furball**, possibly abandoned by his mother because he was **ginger**.

<TextBox title={"By the way"}>
    <p>Remember kids that February is <strong>ginger awareness month</strong>.</p>
    <BlogImage imageName={"ginger"} alt={"Ginger awareness month"} />
    <p>Be kind to the fellow <strong>soulless</strong> and donate <a href={"https://paypal.me/gianlucabelvisi"}>here</a>.</p>
</TextBox>

Semola refuses to **purr**, finds that tuna upsets his stomach, and has a thing for catching sparrows, which he then presents to my sister as tokens of affection, misinterpreting her cries of **horror** for manifestations of delight.

Lastly but not leastly, this cat will play a pivotal role in my **diagnosis**.

# Part 1: Diagnosis

Let's turn the clock back to **January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024**.

I'm in **Italy** visiting family and friends for the holidays and wrapping up the final days working remotely from my parents' place. My flight back to Sweden is set for the 4<sup>th</sup>.

Semola has a particular **fondness** for sitting on my lap while I work. It's not just any lap he chooses. Mine is apparently a prime spot. A sweet piece of real estate. The ultimate chilling location. This is not at all surprising, as the sentiment is echoed by **countless** others who have been blessed with such an exclusive treatment.

<Poll
    id={"lap_sitting"}
    question={"How did you like sitting on my lap?"}
    answers={["It was a once in a lifetime experience!", "It was kinda mid", "I haven't sat on your lap yet"]}
    labels={["Loved it!", "Mid", "DM me"]}
/>

I'm the midst of an afternoon coding session ‚Äî or **pure bliss** as I call it ‚Äî with cat in tow, when I realize that I have to **pee**. A natural consequence of our Italian lunches, where sipping wine is part of the lore and **totally** not an addiction shut up.

But how could I possibly disturb Semola when he is so **contentedly** settled? I mean look at him...

![Semola on my lap](./lap.jpg)

And bear in mind that I can't pee inside a **water bottle** because my company is not a trillion-dollar e-commerce corporation -- or at least not yet -- so the next best option is to recall my catholic upbringing and **endure** it, exactly like Jesus our Lord and Savior did when a donkey sat on his lap (Matthew 23:12).

Later in the evening I'm done with work and have an appointment with a friend for **fika** (of the Swedish kind). To the surprise of no one, I have to pee real bad. I gently move Semola so as not to disturb him...

<ResponsiveEmbed ratio={"16:9"} src={"https://gifer.com/embed/3P6t"}/>

...and sprint to the bathroom to relieve myself.

Now, that was a long pee, and since I like to comment out loud on events that skew **five sigmas** outside the mean, I tell my mother:

<Dialogue>Now, that was a long pee.</Dialogue>

She welcomes the bit of **unsolicited** information, spends a few seconds pondering, then concludes:

<Dialogue>You have diabetes.</Dialogue>

![My mother](./house.png)

<FigureLabel>It's either that or Lupus.</FigureLabel>

You need to understand that my mom is **absolutely** not a doctor. However, she might be a witch.

Given that **number one-ing** for too long can be a sign of **high glucose** in the blood, she insists that I check my level with the measurement device we have at home, being her a fresh type 2 and my sister a type 1 since childhood. And understanding that it's simpler to comply than to discuss the reasons behind my Oppenheimer-level long leak, I prick my finger like in a **satanic** ritual and measure my bloody blood sugar.

The result is **22 mmol/L**.

To put it in context, the normal range is around 3-4 mmol/L and, beyond 28 mmol/L, organs severely **deteriorate**, until you are mostly kinda dead.

![Alternative cover](./cover_alt.png)

<FigureLabel>This is the first iteration on the cover image. It has a ginger cat in it, which I didn't ask for but absolutely loved. When I directly told <strong>Midjourney</strong> to add a cat on my lap, it couldn't figure out the logistics. This is why we still need human artists. Just kidding, no cat is fine!</FigureLabel>

While processing the enormity of the information, I remember that I'm supposed to meet a friend, so I text her:

<Dialogue>Hey so I have to cancel our (swedish) fika because I have diabetes lol.</Dialogue>

Which, grasping at silver linings, is an **amazing** excuse that I can use to pull myself out of anything, replacing my previous and admittedly weaker: _I have a sore face_.

<Dialogue>I'm sorry, I can't come to your <strong>wedding</strong> because I have diabetes. Also, I don't want to be invested in a union I know will not last, and the reason I'm saying this is that I have eyes. But mostly diabetes.</Dialogue>

My father drives me to the ER. The triage nurse acknowledges that this is not normal, but at the same time she has a queue of 50 people that **exploded** their fingers with fireworks on New Year's Eve, so she's like:

<Dialogue>Let's measure it again. If it's below 22, you go home and come back tomorrow.</Dialogue>

It's 25.

<Dialogue>You stay.</Dialogue>

![At the ER](./er2.jpg)

## The Italian hospital

At the hospital, I have an **amazing** experience. The personnel is at their most professional despite 50 **lunatics** running and screaming around the facility with missing fingers and a blood trail.

The only **exception** is a nurse who asks how come I measured my glucose despite having no symptoms. I tell her about the cat, the pee, the witch, and she comments:

<Dialogue>What was your mom even thinking? You should <strong>not</strong> have tested if you didn't have any symptoms.</Dialogue>

I **yes-and** on the obvious joke because, no matter how **dire** things are, I will **never** let a joke un-yes-anded:

<Dialogue>Yeah, this bitch, am I right?</Dialogue>

But then, during my stay, she **repeats** the same remarks two more times, so I am now inclined to think she was serious. üò≠

Be it as it may, the conclusion is that this is most certainly diabetes, with a high probability toward **type 1** because _look at you_. So I have this thing going now!

![Wait but why](wbw.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Original image: <a href={"https://waitbutwhy.com/"}>Wait but why</a></FigureLabel>

The doctor tells me that more analysis is needed. I'm given an insulin stash, glucose measurement tech, and all sorts of **advice** like not eating fika that much. Swedish.

Everything is administered with **kindness** and precision. Which gets me thinking...

<Dialogue>Hey soo, this all looks great but also expensive. Could it be a problem that I am <i>de facto</i> a tourist and that I have not, like, paid taxes in <strong>Italy</strong> for the past 10 years? Plus, I got a speeding ticket in <strong>Florence</strong> back in 2013 that at this point I just refuse to pay also due to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's egregious treatment of <a href={"https://gianlucabelvisi.com/caterina-sforza-1"}>Caterina Sforza</a>, but I digress.</Dialogue>

The doctor types on her computer for a few beats, then reassures me:

<Dialogue>It <strong>seems</strong> like Italy still loves you, signor Belvisi.</Dialogue>

Well, of course. Italy has sat on my lap. Sat on my lap **real** good.

## Interlude: Diabetes

But what is diabetes, anyway?

In **type 1** diabetes, imagine your pancreas as a Facebook friend that has been sharing conspiracy theories for a tad too long. Suddenly, you realize that his posts (insulin) are no longer showing up on your feed (bloodstream). This is because Facebook (the immune system) has decided to **shadow-ban** his ass, and now you have to go on his profile and manually like all the posts about the moon landing being faked by **Stanley Kubrick** so that he could get from NASA those juicy Zeiss f/0.7 lenses he used to shoot indoor candlelight scenes in **Barry Lyndon** (insulin injections).

![Barry Lyndon](barry.png)

<FigureLabel>Totally freaking <strong>worth it.</strong></FigureLabel>

In **type 2** diabetes, imagine your pancreas as this lazy ass security guard...

<YouTube source={"ZN5xiCEsV5o?si=pj4XqdW-m0iF5C6d"} />

There is no certainty on why type 1 diabetes manifests. In part, it is **genetically** determined, but the trigger is unknown. It could be a virus, stress, fatigue, or using a microwave oven to warm up your panties.

There are more certainties on type 2. Your fondness for food, divided by your love for exercise, approaches **infinity**.

## The Swedish hospital

When I get back to Sweden, I spend time figuring out how to go through this sub-quest, and I feel grateful for the help of my friend **Google Translate**.

At the endocrinology ward, I have an **amazing** experience. The personnel is at their most professional despite a **lunatic** running around the facility having not yet figured out after ten years that, in Sweden, the first floor is the ground floor. I'm talking about someone that is not me.

The only **exception** is a nurse who insists that we communicate in Swedish.

<Dialogue>You need to learn, so that you can <strong>become</strong> Swedish.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Well, I'm <strong>already</strong> Swedish, so what you just said was really dumb.</Dialogue>

I say this with my Swedish level of a **second-grader** with a learning disability, which adds to the irony. I think.

Then, I get to meet the doctor. She asks what happened, I start talking about Semola and upon request I show her a **reel** I made of him.

![Semola](./reel.png)

<FigureLabel>If you are a boomer you can click <a target={"_blank"} href={"https://www.instagram.com/p/CnCe-NpIr5k/"}>here</a></FigureLabel>

She concludes that this is most certainly diabetes, with a high probability toward **type 1** because I look fit. I thank her despite not feeling in the mood for lap sitting.

<Dialogue>This must be hard for you.</Dialogue>

I shrug and say not really. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<Dialogue>Well, know that you are in good hands,<GlyphRight/> she adds. <GlyphLeft/>Sweden is in the top percentile with regards to the treatment of diabetes. Inevitably so, because the <strong>highest</strong> concentrations of cases can be found in Finland, Sweden, and Sardinia.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Oh, for real?<GlyphRight/> I raise an eyebrow. <GlyphLeft/>Wait... Sardinia?!</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Yes. For that region we suspect the so called <strong>small island</strong> effect</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Is it a polite way of saying <strong>inbreeding</strong>?</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>...</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Wow, don't get me started with <strong>Sardinians</strong>. I can't stand them. Nobody can. Not only do they leave their home in search for opportunities in <strong>Italy</strong>, but they are so obnoxious in telling us how this is all <strong>temporary</strong>. That nothing compares to Sardinia, be it climate, food, people, and I'm like why don't you and your defective genes <strong>eff off</strong> back to that island of yours and, like, swim in your transparent waters, enjoy your high longevity life, grow your organic food, cook your juicy piglets, and make love to your beautiful goats? But I digress.</Dialogue>

![Sardinians](./sardinians.png)

<FigureLabel>Young Sardinians.</FigureLabel>

The doctor tells me that **genetics** account for around 20% of the diagnoses for type 1, so the rest has to be **environmental**. There must be something in Finland and Sweden that makes people sick. So let's update the tally of **shit hands** I have been handed by this country in increasing order of severity:

1. I was [assaulted](/wink)
2. My boots were stolen at the gym in 2017. (No blog post yet. Too soon. üò≠)
3. I got [diabetes](/diabetes)

She adds that more analysis is needed. I'm given an insulin stash and glucose measurement tech that I **attach** directly to my skin and sends data to the phone. Then, through the phone, it's **forwarded** to the hospital so that they can track in real time if I'm alive and in case send flowers.

![Thirst trap](./sensor.jpg)

<FigureLabel>Pardon the thirst trap.</FigureLabel>

As is the case for Italy, this is all **free** because in Europe we recognize that the individual is not an island, but the integral part of a Community. The higher taxation level ensures the help of those in need.

Then again, I'm not really paying taxes in Sweden, am I? I'm paying them in **Denmark**. Let's keep this between us.

<YouTube source={"OtIZL1U49G8"}/>

<FigureLabel>Sound on.</FigureLabel>

Finally, the doctor tells me that there is an ongoing study at the **Lund University Hospital** looking into halting the deterioration of the pancreas in newly diagnosed type 1s. Would I be interested in participating? Heck yeah!, I say.

A few minutes later, my mind goes to the students in Lund I have hung out with. Their **drinking habits**. Their allergy for challenging tasks. So here I am hoping that I'll end up in the control group!

## Conclusions

As you can imagine, this is a whole thing!

But-- is **traumatic** a part of the whole? Should you feel bad for me? Should I? Absolutely not! It's not what happens to you but how you-- wait let's hear it from Gandalf.

<YouTube source={"2jC-rRPKZ3U?si=PL0L0hvZjbRw0hkt&amp;start=9"}/>

<FigureLabel>Ignore the part where they talk about jewelry.<br/>Fun fact: right after this scene, Gandalf went and told <strong>Pippin</strong> to kill himself.</FigureLabel>

For what it's worth, I'm keeping my **chin** up, my **spirits** joyous, my **memes** based and blue-pilled. I'm not gonna let this thing get to me.

![The big lie](./chat.jpg)

This is where the post should have reached its natural conclusion, but I can't end it here because I have been **lying** to you.

You see, even though externally I'm vibing, internally I'm **malding**.

# Part 2: Malding

<TextBox title="" closeable={true}>
    <p><i>From mald +‚Äé -ing, itself a blend of mad +‚Äé bald.</i></p>
    <p>
        Malding is a slang word used to describe an angry person. A combo of the words <strong>mad</strong> and <strong>balding</strong>, malding refers to someone (often a gamer) who gets extremely heated about something to the point where they could metaphorically pull out their hair.
    </p>
</TextBox>

In the days following the diagnosis, I feel **angry** as I've never felt in my life.

I need to take breaks to ‚úåüèº**calm the eff down**‚úåüèº, hating every injection as if I was in **death row**, waking up in the middle of the night with acid refluxes.

Not only am I angry, but I know that I'm the **worst** kind of angry. The kind that cannot be pointed at anything. Not the government, not the diet, not the lack of exercise or a decadent lifestyle. And as much as I would love to blame **Jesus**, let's face it, the guy (or gal) is innocent.

## Getting help

The thing with me is I **never** ask for help. I should probably work on it, but that would involve asking for help, so I'm sure you understand the **Catch-22** here.

That said, since day one of my diagnosis I have received **unasked** help from one of my closest friends.

Someone that I have known since we were **single digits** years sold. Someone that, when I fell into a frozen stream while **snowboarding** off-piste, threw red bulls at me to give me the wings to escape the pit. Someone I made **sushi** with in my apartment in Pisa, then we went out, followed a trail of candles in **Borgo Stretto**, ended up at a student party, **blacked out** and recollected the missing bits the next day by checking the photos like in that film. Someone with whom half of our conversations are made of **references** to our favorite movies.

![Nothing left to do but cry](./non_ci_resta_che_piangere.jpg)

Someone who has recently been **injecting** insulin, but for a significantly different reason.

## His diagnosis

Let's turn the clock back to **August 2023**.

My friend is at the hospital. The doctors are not loving the scan of his **pancreas** but, they say, this is one of the variants that have symptoms early on. Meaning we got this in time. The outlook is **positive**.

The head surgeon at the hospital in Pisa is **world-class**. The surgery is done via robots through tiny holes. The pancreas unfortunately fights back, as it happens for 25% of the patients. The stitches do not hold and the projected two weeks of hospitalization become six. Two additional surgeries are needed and the final decision is to **remove** the pancreas entirely.

Hence, the need for **insulin**.

In September, I fly back to Italy to visit him, but he is not out of the woods yet. I finally see him during **Christmas** and he looks great. The 20 kilograms he lost, he **regained**. He's even back to working out, albeit with mild intensity.

Every year, I and other friends are invited to his place for the **Christmas dinner**. A role that I have is to impersonate **Santa Claus** for his children of two and four. This is something that I absolutely love because:

1. It reminds me of my **acting** days back then, or more recently when I have humble-braggingly dated a Danish actress who broke my heart
2. I enjoy **lying** to kids maybe a bit too much

This year, I want to deliver a **performance** for the ages. That will teach her!

I want to go full **Method Acting**. I want a Santa that respects tradition, but at the same time caters to **Generation Alpha**. A woke Santa instead of a homophobic one. The first Santa in the world that, instead of HO HO HO, says **poggers**.

![Santa](./santa2.jpeg)

<FigureLabel>Poggers.</FigureLabel>

At the same time, I know that any creative process is **collaborative**, so I'm open to integrating my vision with my friend's notes.

<Dialogue>Listen, don't take this the wrong way, but the less you talk, the better.</Dialogue>

## My diagnosis

Which brings us to **January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024**. The cat, the pee, the witch. Basically the title of a **Narnia** novel.

My friend waits no time and invites me for lunch the **very next** day.

<Dialogue>It might seem <strong>overwhelming</strong>,<GlyphRight/> he tells me while grilling meat. <GlyphLeft/>But trust me, it's not. It's just a chore that you do without even thinking about it. And mind you, this is coming from someone who hates needles.</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Oh yeah, I get it. No big deal,<GlyphRight/> I reply while secretly <strong>malding</strong>.<GlyphLeft/>And you know what I could even be prescribed with <strong>Metformin</strong>, which seems to be tied to longevity.</Dialogue>

We continue chatting about our project to make **version 3.0** of his commercial website, which I have been developing thanks to the skills accumulated with this **wonderful blog**.

Then, he tells me that he's opening a **showroom** area at his office, in a vintage style that includes a pinball and an arcade coin operated machine that runs in **emulation** all the games released before 2000.

![Arcade](./coinop.png)

Which is:

1. Freaking awesome
2. Kinda illegal

Now, we are not lawyers, but we believe that point 1 cancels out point 2, so it's all good.

<Dialogue>Including Metal Slug?</Dialogue>

<Dialogue>Including Metal Slug.</Dialogue>

![Metal Slug](./metal_slug.jpg)

## Back to Sweden

On the following day, I travel back to Sweden and start talking to doctors and nurses while **malding** real good.

My friend texts me daily and asks for updates. He wants to see my **glucose sensor** as it's version 3, which hasn't reached Italy yet and is, like, half the size. Poggers.

He insists on checking my numbers across the day and compare them with the units of insulin I inject. More often than not, he **mocks** me because the glucose levels look like the **stock market**.

He asks me how much **slow absorption** insulin I'm taking during the night. I tell him.

<Dialogue>Those are rookie numbers,<GlyphRight/> he replies. <GlyphLeft/>You gotta pump those numbers up.</Dialogue>

<ResponsiveEmbed ratio={"16:9"} src={"https://giphy.com/embed/hs8SqOYWARxO8"} />

Then, I go on a **win-streak**. I bounce those levels between the pink and the stink like a pro.

I text my friend to un-humble-brag about it...

![Streak](./giochesse.jpeg)

To which he doesn't reply.

He must be busy, I think. I want to write him:

<Dialogue>YO, I NEED SOME FUCKING VALIDATION RIGHT NOW üôà</Dialogue>

But I'm also busy.

Little did I know that, in that very moment, my friend was at the hospital, kissing his children **goodnight** for the last time.

## Loss

Initially, I deny this reality.

I just can't begin to process how a person with a **pinball** in the checkout cart can die. You don't get to order a pinball and die. It's fucked up. It doesn't make any sense. The malding instantly stops, replaced by **grief**.

More so, I feel like a silly, silly, silly, silly man with my anger over literally nothing, **occupying** my friend's mind in his final days with such mundane matters.

I know that there is a teaching here, and while I'm thinking about the teaching here, I am reminded of something that makes me almost **throw away** this entire post.

In my [previous article](/getting-a-dog) I wrote...

![Well](doggo.png)

Well, am I doing the **thing**? Am I making my friend's death about me?

I reflect on it. Maybe I can write a concise, compelling, and possibly funny paragraph illustrating how this is not the case. That I'm not making it about myself. And if the writing is **good enough**, it can even become true. But it's not. I **am** making it about myself. I am using my friend's life, turning it into a story that **serves** me.

I don't know how much he **knew** that those were his last days. I like to think that he did and that he didn't care because he was too busy living them. This is the final **teaching** I'm sifting from him among the dozen others throughout our 40+ years of friendship.

The teaching is that I will be ok.

I will be ok not as a **wishful** prediction, but as a statement of **intent**.

And when and if events **unfold** in my life making things not ok, I will still be ok in the new context I am **dealt with**.

I will be ok because that is my **preference**. My stubborn, unyielding promise. My way of paying respect. I will be ok as an inevitability.

# Appendix

The **funeral** is on a Tuesday. To make it, I book a last minute expensive flight to Florence via Amsterdam, leaving the evening before.

Three hours to boarding time, **KLM** texts me:

<Dialogue>Sooo, your expensive flight has been <strong>cancelled</strong> due to expensive snow in Amsterdam.</Dialogue>

Among the **alternatives**, there is only one that gets me there on time. I book a literal last minute flight to **Paris**. I spend the night at the **Orly** airport sitting on an uncomfortable chair and killing time by coding (**pure bliss**). At 6:00am I board a plane for Bologna. There, I take a high-speed train to Florence, miss the regional connection that leaves right in front of me, grab the following one and manage to reach the church a whole three minutes late.

After the funeral, I get drinks with friends and family of the deceased. Together, we **reminisce** his life and our shared memories, not without resounding laughs, which is what funerals are for.

Finally, I reach my parents' home and **collapse** on the sofa.

When I wake up at dinner time, who do I find **towering** over me?

![Semola](./semola_footer.png)
